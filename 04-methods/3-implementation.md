## Development 

We believe at CivicActions that we are not just responsible for architecting a site, but rather a complete site experience. Our site building reflects a careful and thorough approach to all site user needs so that users can perform their tasks without the system getting in the way. 

Some strategies we employ to improve the backend user experience include:
* decluttering the user interface
* presenting as few options as necessary and hiding additional options in vertical tabs, * crafting important help text
* providing customized dashboards
* configuring rules and workflow options
* creating administrative views to perform common bulk content operations. 

Our mission is to implement a content management experience that empowers all users of the system, not just technical administrators. While we strive to put important site configuration in code so that it can be tested before release, versioned in repositories, and easily deployed, content remains in the database so that users can make changes without needing to call their local site admin.

As for our front end development approach, CivicActions uses a design component driven approach in order to implement our designs. Developers and designers work together to identify reusable design patterns to code once and extend as needed to minimize code complexity and size, reduce negative performance impacts, allow for easy maintainability and scalability, and also ensure that design changes can be made once and reflected throughout the site. We utilize a SMACSS-based approach (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) for writing our CSS and organizing our files, as well as the Sass CSS preprocessor in order to write cleaner, more maintainable code. 

## Code Review 

To ensure that our code is as stable and scalable as possible, we adopt a rigorous code review and automated testing process that is designed to prevent bugs from entering the system. Each developer that touches the site works on his or her own local computer and pushes code to their own branch of the projectâ€™s Git repository. Once they submit a merge request to contribute code to the main project, a Tech Lead or fellow engineer will review the code for any errors, syntax, and potential performance impacts. After the code review is complete, a Jenkins build will verify whether the code is stable before it can be pulled into a development environment, where internal QA will be performed before the final client signoff. These multiple layers of workflow ensure that code and its subsequent functionality have been reviewed substantially before impacting a production environment.

## Automated Testing 

In addition to the code review process, we employ automated testing such as Behat, or behavior driven testing, or Selenium to make sure that new functionality and code is performing as expected and no regressions have been introduced into the system. Tests should be written for each user story in order to verify that the story is complete.

Additional testing we perform regularly at CivicActions includes accessibility testing, automated browser testing and security testing using tools such as the WAVE toolbar, Quail, Cross Browser Testing, and coder testing with security scripts. 

## Web Performance 

Another essential ingredient of web development at CivicActions is web performance. We at CivicActions take a holistic approach to web performance, utilizing opportunities to optimize through front-end development, backend development, hardware configuration, caching, content delivery networks, etc. To optimize web performance, we:
* use as few modules as possible
* concatenate and minify all code
* losslessly compress image assets
* use reverse-proxy caching such as Varnish to cache all static content
* serve files and pages from a CDN
* implement backend solutions such as Memcache. 

We frequently scan page speed times using tools such as Page Speed, YSlow, and server and application monitoring tools. Image assets are generally eschewed in favor of icon fonts and/or sprites when necessary. Instead of using unnecessary Javascript, we use CSS3 animations with appropriate fallbacks when available.
