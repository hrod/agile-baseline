##Sprint 0 Discovery Process

During initial project discovery, we perform various research and design-related activities to achieve the following goals:

- Understand business needs
- Understand current/historical context
- Understand users
- Understand content needs
- Understand technical needs
- Understand testing needs
- Understand desired high-level outcomes
- Understand major risks and assumptions
- Envision solutions

###What's the difference between Sprint 0 in Agile vs Sprint 0 in Waterfall?

// NEEDS RECONCILING 

When we begin a project, we focus on and leverage stakeholder and end user interviews in order to adequately inform our content strategy moving forward. These inputs, combined with our extensive Drupal experience, allow us to make fundamentally sound and lasting recommendations for content organization. This organization is reflected in the developed content structures, site navigation, and site features in concert. Subsequently, recommendations are implemented with our preferred mobile-first strategy.

We conduct the following analysis activities aimed at substantiating a user-centered result:

* Initial Discovery activities, to understand the audience, user personas, digital strategy, and goals of the project
* Surveys and interviews (virtually or in-person) of stakeholders and representative users, aimed at revising and validating the defined strategies
* Content audits and analytics analysis, to quantitatively and qualitatively identify gaps in your current strategy. We produce data visualization summaries that identify insights for the audience and content use, define an inventory of potential content migration needs, propose a candidate information architecture, and help solidify the goals based on the identified gaps
* Card sorting and mind mapping activities on candidate users, performed to measure and validate the efficacy of our proposed strategy.

The results from all areas of user research are captured in a report that outlines user personas and key findings, along with with strategies for improvement. We generally do not stipulate too many project details at the outset here, but instead focus on capturing goals, key context, user personas, stories, architectural recommendations, and flows. We stay agile and save time by avoiding premature planning, deferring these conversations until there is a more solid foundation upon which to iron out details. Prioritizing and planning as we go also enables us to create elegant solutions founded on the insights we gathered along the way.

An overview of proposed Sprint 1 deliverables would include:
* Discovery session meeting notes and summary
* User and stakeholder surveys and interview: raw results and key findings into a web strategy
* User personas, user stories and user flows based on discovery and user research
* Mind maps and low/high fidelity wireframe prototypes
* Technical content and data audit results, including appropriate data visualization to summarize findings
* High level content/information architecture recommendations and migration needs
* Potential design comps and/or style guide based on the user-based feedback
